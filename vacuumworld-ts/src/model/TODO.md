# TODO

## TO IMPLEMENT (some discussion regarding the integration with Teleora is needed for all of these)

- The entire `VacuumWorld` class (the entry point of the application + arguments validation)
- `VWEnvironment.getActorMindCorePath()`
- `VWCleaningAgentMind.loadFromFile()`
- `VWUserMind.loadFromFile()`
